PERSONAL USE
These fonts are SHAREWARE, that means you can use them
for free for 30 days and after that I hope that you are
kind enough to pay the 10 US$ shareware fee if you want
to use this font more. I won't chase you with a blow
torch but if you enjoy my fonts support my work so that
I can make more shareware fonts!

COMMERCIAL USE
If you plan on using one of my shareware fonts in a
commercial project then it's not enough with just 10
us$, the fee for using one of my shareware fonts in
a commercial project is 100 US$. Contact me at my email
address (grizzly@fucker.com) if you want to use one of
my shareware fonts in a commercial project.

(commercial project = advertisements, cd-booklets,
corporate websites, movie posters, etc)

Also, the license for commercial use is for 2 CPUs
and one printer, you'll get a license file when you
pay me. the extra charge if you have to use it on
